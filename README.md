# Hi Everyone!
This project utilizes the Quantized 4-Bit LLaMA-2 7B LLM model, enabling users to interact with their document files (in CSV or PDF format) through a conversational interface.

Users can upload a document and ask natural language questions about its content, receiving human-like responses generated by the model. This functionality makes it easier to explore and extract insights from documents without needing technical expertise in data analysis or programming.
